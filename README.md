# 🇩🇪 German Vocabulary Trainer

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is still in development and was created for internal/personal use to support my own German vocabulary learning journey.

A command-line tool to practice and test your German vocabulary through interactive quizzes.  
Supports English-to-German and German-to-English modes, audio output, word search, and review functionality.

## 📚 Features

- ✅ English → German and German → English quiz modes
- 🎯 Progress tracking with success rate and weak word review
- 🔊 Audio support including microphone resume and stop controls
- 🔍 Search functionality for quick lookups
- 📖 Word list viewing by chapter (based on Netzwek B1 - Glossary)
- 📦 Modular structure using external `word_list` and `speech_output` modules


Make sure all required files (`word_list.py`, `speech_output.py`) are in the same folder.
